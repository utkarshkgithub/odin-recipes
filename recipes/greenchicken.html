        <p><em>This chicken enchilada casserole recipe is so good that my four picky kids eat it 
            â€” and I got my picture in the paper for it! If you want to skip the charring step,
             simply tear the tortillas into quarters so they absorb the sauce better.</em></p>
        <h3><strong>Ingredients</strong></h3>
        <ul>
            <li>4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>
                <li>garlic salt to taste</li>
                <li>18 (6 inch) corn tortillas, torn in half</li>
                <li>1 (28 ounce) can green chile enchilada sauce</li>
                <li>1 (16 ounce) package shredded Monterey Jack cheese</li>
                <li>1 (8 ounce) container reduced fat sour cream</li>
        </ul>
        <h3><strong>Directions</strong></h3>
        <h4>Step 1</h4>
        <p>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a 
            medium baking dish. </p>
        <h4>Step 2</h4>
        <p> Season chicken with garlic salt; arrange in the prepared baking dish. Bake in the 
            preheated oven until no longer pink and juices run clear, about 45 minutes. An 
            instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees  
            F (74 degrees C).
        </p>
        <h4>Step 3</h4>
        <p>Cool, shred, and set aside. </p>
        <h4>Step 4</h4>
        <p>Meanwhile, char each tortilla half over the open flame of a gas stove burner 
            using metal tongs until lightly puffed, about 1 minute. </p>
        <h4>Step 5</h4>
        <p>Pour about 1/2 inch enchilada sauce into the bottom of a medium baking dish; 
            arrange 6 tortillas in a single layer on top. </p>
        <h4>Step 6</h4>
        <p> Sprinkle with 1/2 of the chicken, 1/3 of the cheese, 1/2 of the sour cream, and 
            1/3 of the remaining enchilada sauce.
        </p>
        <h4>Step 7</h4>
        <p>Repeat layers. Coat remaining tortillas thoroughly with some of the remaining 
            enchilada sauce and arrange on top. Sprinkle with remaining cheese and top 
            with any remaining enchilada sauce. 
        </p>
        <h4>Step 8</h4>
        <p>Cover and bake in the preheated oven for 45 minutes. 
            Cool slightly before serving. </p>
