    <h1>Homemade Mac and Cheese</h1>
    <p>This mac and cheese recipe with a buttered bread crumb topping is creamy and \
        comforting. It's easy to make the cheese sauce from scratch on your stovetop, 
        starting with a roux and adding milk, Cheddar, and Parmesan, resulting in a rich,
        decadent sauce that coats every nook and cranny of the noodles.

    <h2><strong>Ingredients</strong></h2>
    <h4><em>Macaroni and Cheese:</em></h4>
    <ul>
        <li>

            8 ounces uncooked elbow macaroni
            </li>
            <li>

                ¼ cup salted butter

            3 tablespoons all-purpose flour
            </li>
            <li>

                2 ½ cups milk, or more as needed
                </li>
                <li>

                    2 cups shredded sharp Cheddar cheese
                    </li>
                    <li>

                        ½ cup finely grated Parmesan cheese
                        </li>
                        <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste (Optional)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4><strong>Bread Crumb Topping:</strong></h4>
        <ul>
            <li>

                2 tablespoons salted butter
                </li>
                <li>

                    ½ cup dry bread crumbs
                    </li>
                    <li>

                        1 pinch ground paprika
                        </li>
        </ul>

    <h2><strong>Directions</strong></h2>
    <h3>Step 1</h3>
    <p>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease an 8-inch square baking dish. </p>
    <h3>Step 2</h3>
    <p>Make the macaroni and cheese: Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add macaroni and simmer, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes; it will finish cooking in the oven. Drain and transfer to the prepared baking dish. </p>
    <h3>Step 4</h3>
    <p>While the macaroni is cooking, melt 1/4 cup butter in a medium skillet over low heat. Whisk in flour and stir until the mixture becomes paste-like and light golden brown, 3 to 5 minutes. </p>
    <h3>Step 5</h3>
    <p>

        Make the bread crumb topping: Melt 2 tablespoons butter in a skillet over medium heat. Add bread crumbs; cook and stir until well coated and browned. Spread bread crumbs over macaroni and cheese, then sprinkle with paprika.
        
        </p>
    <h3>Step 6</h3>
    <p>Bake in the preheated oven until topping is golden brown and macaroni and cheese is bubbling, about 30 minutes. </p>
